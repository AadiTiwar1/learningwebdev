      <h3>Meet the Founders</h3>
      <p>EnrichedCS was founded by John Doe and Jane Doe, two passionate tech enthusiasts who wanted to make a difference in their community. With backgrounds in computer science and education, they saw a need for more opportunities for students to learn about coding and decided to start EnrichedCS to fill that gap.</p>
